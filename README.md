# My First neovim Plugin
I always run into situations where there are alternate files to a given file and it was a very noticeable problem 
but the ecosystem did not provide a good system that match my needs. Therefore, I want to create this
minimalist alternate type plugin where you have to choose one thing and it would work for all. 

I hope it does not require a lot of overhead.
